# Dynamic-Model-of-Quad
Dynamic Model of a Quad-Rotor in MATLAB Simulink

+ Glob.m - contains all the constants
+ fandm1.m - all forces and moments are calculated
+ dynamics.m - net forces in X,Y,Z direction calculation followed by implementation of dynamics
+ QuadDynamics.slx - the simulink model
+ Bouabdallah_PhD thesis_design and control of quadrotors_Bouabdallah - used this as reference
